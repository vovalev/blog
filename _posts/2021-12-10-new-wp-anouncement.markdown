description: "#fincap is the first crowd-sourced empirical paper in Economics/Finance. More than a 150 research teams participated in this study to shed some light on how Evidence-Generating Process can be a source of non-standard error - an additional level of uncertainty - in academic research."

I am proud to share, that I have participaped in the [#fincap](https://fincap.academy "fincap homepage") project coordinated by Albert J. Menkveld, Anna Dreber, Felix Hozmeister, Juergen Huber, Magnus Johannesson, Michael Kirchler, Michael Razen and Utz Weitzel in collaboration with the Deutsche BÃ¶rse AG.

The project resulted in a first crowd-sourced empirical paper in Economics and Finance that looks into an Evidence-Generating Process (EGP). 
EGP consists of defining (i) a model, (ii) a method, and (iii) an execution mechanism required to test a hypotesis.
It can be roughly described as *"the way of tackling a research question"*, that may differ from one research team to another.

The paper finds that the **additional uncertainty** due to the variation in the EGP is not negligible and

- Only weakly covaries with the research team "quality",
- Declines significantly after peer-feedback,
- Underestimated by the researchers.
