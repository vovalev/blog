description: "Complex systems research has been at the forefront of scientific priorities for some time and many very interesting phenomena have been identified and explored in the context of a wide variety of applications. This workshop is part of a series, reflecting on an emerging movement to develop a mathematical theory for sudden changes in the dynamical behaviour of complex systems, so-called critical transitions.
