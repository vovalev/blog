Wellcome to my webpage! I am a doctoral candidate in Finance at the University of Luxembourg. In 2017, I received my master degree in Economics and Finance from the University of Luxembourg and the Higher School of Economics (Moscow).

My research agenda is focused on financial markets structure, with applications to liquidity, price discovery, and market design. In particular, I am interested in such topics as:

- Dark Trading
- Exchanges
- High-Frequency Trading
- Financial Crashes
