[Dark Pools and Price Discovery in Limit Order Markets](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3880047 "SSRN abstract"), 2020.

**Abstract:** This paper examines how the introduction of a dark pool impacts price discovery, market quality, and aggregate welfare of traders. I use a four-period model where rational and risk-neutral agents choose the order type and the venue and obtain the equilibrium numerically. The comparative statics on the order submission probability suggests a U-shaped order migration to the dark pool. The overall effect of dark trading on market quality and aggregate welfare was found to be positive but limited in size and depended on market conditions. I find mixed results for the process of price discovery. Depending on the immediacy need of traders, price discovery may change due to the presence of the dark venue.

[Dark Trading and Financial Markets Stability](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3384719 "SSRN abstract"), 2020, with Jorge Gonçalves, and Roman Kräussl.

**Abstract:** This paper examines how the implementation of a new dark order - Midpoint Extended Life Order (M-ELO) on NASDAQ - impacts financial markets stability in terms of occurrences of mini-flash crashes in individual securities. We use high-frequency order book data and apply panel regression analysis to estimate the effect of dark order trading activity on market stability and liquidity provision. The results suggest a predominance of a speed bump effect of M-ELO rather than a darkness effect. We find that the introduction of M-ELO increases market stability by reducing the average number of mini-flash crashes, but its impact on market quality is mixed.
